**Name: Affect Mind (CHA)**  
_Force Skill; Requires Force Sensitive and Alter Feats_    
You can use the Force to alter a target's perceptions or make a telepathic suggestion in another character's mind.  
**Check:** The result of an Affect Mind check sets the DC for the target's Will save. (Note that this skill works best on weak-willed characters. Those with good Will save bonuses are harder to fool with "Jedi mind tricks.")  

| Result  	| Will Saving Throw DC 	|
|---------	|:--------------------:	|
| Up to 4 	|           5          	|
| 5-14    	|          10          	|
| 15-24   	|          15          	|
| 25-34   	|          20          	|
| 35+     	|          25          	|  

Declare whether you are attempting to alter perceptions or make a suggestion when you make your Affect Mind check. If the target's saving throw fails, you can do one of the following things.  
_Alter Perceptions:_ This creates a simple false stimulus, such as brief sound or fleeting image, detected by a single person and lasting no more than a single round. It is generally used to distract an opponent, which can also have the effect of feint (see Bluff). Note that the targets receive a +2 circumstance bonus on their saving throw for every additional person beyond the first that you want to detect the false stimulus.  
Obi-Wan Kenobi uses this application of this skill in A New Hope to distract the stormtroopers aboard the Death Star.  
_Suggestion:_ This is a classic "Jedi Mind Trick", allowing you to make an otherwise unpalatable suggestion seem completely acceptable to the target. You must be able to communicate with the target, and the suggestion can't obviously threaten the target's life. The target won't wont realize later that what they did was unreasonable.  
Obi-Wan Kenobi successfully uses this application of this skill to get past the stormtrooper in A New Hope. Jabba the Hutt and Watto both make their Will saves against this application of the skill in Return of the Jedi and The Phantom Menace, respectively.  
**Retry:** No. You can attempt to affect the mind of the same character in another situation after time has passed, but not in the same encounter or scene.   
**Special:** You can take 10 when making an Affect Mind check, but you can't take 20.  
A character with the Mind Trick feat gets a +2 aptitude bonus on Affect Mind checks.  
**Time:** Affect Mind is a full-round action.  
**Vitality Point Cost:** 2 (alter perceptions); 4 (suggestion)
