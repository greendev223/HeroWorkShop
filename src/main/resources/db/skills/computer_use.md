**Name: Computer Use (INT)**    
Use this skill to access computer systems and write or modify computer programs, to reprogram droids, and to override or bypass computer-controlled devices.  
**Check:** Most normal computer operations (such as running a program) don't require a skill check. However, conducting a complex search through numerous databases, writing computer programs to make complex calculations or manipulate data in specific ways, altering existing programs to perform differently (better or worse), and breaking through computer security are all relatively difficult and require skill checks.  
_Conduct Complex Search:_ Researching a topic on the HoloNet (or its equivalent in different eras) with a combination of search engines and a lot of site hits takes time, skill, and some luck. The GM determines how obscure a particular topic is (the more obscure, the higher the DC) and what kind of information might be available. In some cases, the GM might require that the character break into a secure site before conducting the search to obtain certain kinds of information.  
Information ranges from general to protected. For example, locating general information about a senator is easier than getting specific information (such as a senator's date of birth), which is easier than finding restricted information (such as a senator's private comm channel code), which is easier than uncovering protected information (such as the senator's cred stick code).  

| Information Type 	| DC 	|
|------------------	|:---:	|
| General          	| 10 	|
| Specific         	| 15 	|
| Restricted*      	| 20 	|
| Protected*       	| 25 	|  
\* Usually requires a check to break into a site before a search can be made.  

_Write Program:_ The DC depends on the nature of the program and its purpose, ranging from 15 for simple programs (such as databases ro accounting applications) to 30 for complex programs (such as maintenance analysis applications or security protocol systems).  
_Alter Programs:_ It's generally easier to alter an existing program than create a new one from scratch. The DC depends on what the alteration sets out to accomplish and whether or not the user wants their tampering to readily obvious.  
_Break Computer Security:_ Also called "slicing", this application of Computer Use can't be used untrained. In cases where the other user is actively combating the slicer's efforts, a slicer has to beat an opposing computer user's check result. In general, though, the DC is determined by the quality of the security program installed to defend the system. If the check fails by 10 or more, the security system immediately alerts its administrator that there has been an unauthorized entry.  
_Operate Remote:_ Many devices--security cameras, communications arrays, door locks, sentry guns, alarms, and so forth--are computer-operated via remote links. A slicer can access these various systems and either shut them off, or change their operating parameters (to make Corporate Sector cameras identify CSA agents as enemies, for example, or to set an automated Imperial sentry gun to attack stormtroopers). If the check fails by 10 or more, the security system immediately alerts its administrator that there has been an unauthorized entry.  
_Ship Systems:_ On ships that require more than one operator, a character's Computer Use skill is employed to determine the success of using sensors, weapons, and shields. Opposed checks are needed to overcome sensor or communications jamming. The better the check when operating sensors, the more detailed information discovered. Note that sensors in the Star Wars universe are not miraculous divination machines. At best, they provide detection and identification assistance based on what can be seen, measured, and analyzed: the number of enemy vessels, the type of enemy vessels, the basic makeup of a planetary atmosphere, any visible obstacles or dangers in the immediate vicinity, and so forth.  
**Retry:** None.   
**Special:** You can take 10 when using the Computer Use skill. In cases that don't involve a penalty for failure, you can take 20.  
A character with the Gearhead feat gets a +2 aptitude bonus on Computer Use checks.    
**Time:** Computer Use requires at least a full-round action. The GM may determine that some tasks require several rounds, a few minutes, or longer, as described above.  
**Vitality Point Cost:** None.
