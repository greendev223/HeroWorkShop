**Name: Astrogate (INT)**  
_Trained Only_  
Use this skill to plot a course through hyperspace from one star system to another.  
**Check:** You can plot a safe course through hyperspace between two star systems. The result of an Astrogate check determines whether a particular trip occurs without incident and how much time the trip takes; a failed check indicates either a delayed journey or the possibility of a hyperspace mishap that can ruin the journey. For information  
You can also use this skill to determine your position in space without the use of a navigational computer by checking the constellationsâ€”provided you are traveling through an area of space you are familiar with.  
**Retry:** None.   
**Special:** You can take 10 when making an Astrogate check, but you can't take 20 since there is a possible penalty for failing.  
A character with the Spacer feat and at least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 aptitude bonus on Astrogate checks.  
**Time:** Astrogating a course takes one minute.  
**Vitality Point Cost:** None.
