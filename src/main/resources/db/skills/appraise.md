**Name: Appraise (INT)**  
<!-- _Force Skill; Requires Feats; Armor Check Penalty_ -->  
Use this skill to estimate the value of an object, from an old blaster to an Alderaanian heirloom.  
**Check:** You can appraise common or well-known objects within 10% of their value (DC 12). Failure means you estimate the value at 50% to 150% of actual value. The GM secretly rolls 2d6+3, multiples by 10%, multiples the actual value by that percentage, and tells you what you think the value of the item is. (For a common or well-known item, your chance of estimating the value within 10% is fairly high, even if you fail the check-in such a case, consider it a lucky guess.)  
For example, a beat-up droid is offered for sale by a Jawa trader and you want to determine the droid's approximate value before getting into a haggling session. If you fail the check (which the GM might decide to make in secret for you so you don't know), the GM rolls 2d6+3 and gets the result of 12. They multiple this by 10% for a result of 120%. The actual value of the droid is 2,000 credits. Multiplying 2,000 by 120%, the GM tells you that you gauge the value of the droid to be about 2,400 credits. Since you failed the check, you believe that the droid is worth more than it actually is.
Rare or exotic items require a check of DC 15, 20, or higher. If successful, you estimate the value at 70% to 130% of its actual value. The GM secretly rolls 2d4+5, multiplies by 10%, multiplies the actual value by that percentage, and tells you what you believe the value of the item is. Failure means you can't estimate the item's value.
The result of an appraise check should have an affect on the story, as in the case of the Jawa trader above, who might end up making some money off you. On the other hand, with a successful appraise check, you might determine that the offer a starship dealer gives you is just too good to pass up.  
**Retry:** Not of the same object, regardless of success.   
**Special:** When making the check untrained, for common items failure means you make no estimate (you can take a wild guess if you want), for rare items success means an estimate of 50% to 150% (2d6+3 multiplied by 10%).  
You can take 10 when making an appraise check, but you can't take 20.
**Time:** Appraising an item takes one minute.  
**Vitality Point Cost:** None.
