**Name: Craft (INT)**  
You are trained in a craft, trade, or art such as electronics, sculpture, mechanics, weaponmaking, starship construction, carpentry, computer technology, droid construction, or some other endeavor that actually creates a finished product. A Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something; if a skill is not of this sort, it is a Profession skill.  
Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You can have several Craft skills. For instance, you could have the skill Craft (electronic devices). Your ranks in that skill don't affect any checks you happen to make for different Craft skills, such as Craft (blaster pistols and rifles) or Craft (droids), for example.  
Examples of Craft skills include tha following. Your GM may allow other Craft skills, depending on the campaign.

*This category of the Craft skill applies to only on kind of exotic weapon; to create two different kinds of exotic weapons, you must purchase this Craft skill separately for each weapon. Craft (lightsaber) is a skill only available to Force-users; special rules are given for the use of this Craft skill.  

Before you can use a Craft skill, you must purchase a set of basic tools. The cost of these tools varies according to the complexity of the item you want to build (see the accompanying table). The tools to make an item of a certain complexity can also be used to make any item of lower complexity. To upgrade your basic tools and thus be able to make items of higher complexity, you only need to spend the difference in cost between the tools you have and the tools you are acquiring. For example, if you spend 150 credits on basic tools to make items of high complexity, you can also make items of medium and low complexity using the same tools. If you later decide you want to make items of extreme complexity, you must spend another 850 credits (1,000 minus 150) to acquire the necessary tools.  
Having the ideal tools for the job creates a condition of favorable circumstances, giving you a +2 circumstance bonus on all you Craft checks. The cost to acquire ideal tools for items of a certain complexity is 10 times the cost of basic tools. For example, the cost of ideal tools to make items of high complexity is 1,500 credits.  
**Check:** The basic function of the Craft skill is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The price of the item and your check results determine how long it takes to make the item. The items' price also determines the cost of raw materials (the parts and components necessary to build the item).  
To determine how much time and money it takes to make an item:  

1. Find the item's price in the Equipment List, or have the GM set the price for an item not listed.  
2. Pay one-third the item's price in raw materials.  
3. Make a skill check that represents one day's work.  

Multiply the check result by your skill modifier (your skill ranks + your Intelligence modifier + miscellaneous modifier). If that number equals or exceeds the item's price, then you have completed the item.  
If your check result multiplied by your skill modifier is less than the item's price, then that number represents progress you've made this day toward completing the item. Subtract the amount of progress from the item's price and record the new reduced value. At the end of the next day of work, make another check. Each day, you make more progress until the day when your check result multiplied by your skill modifier equals or exceeds the item's remaining value. At that point, you have completed the item.  
You can hand an unfinished item over to someone else to complete, or, if the item is sufficiently large, multiple craftsman can work on the item simultaneously. In either case, use the total results of all the Craft checks applied to the item to determine when the item is finished.  
Upon the item's completion, make another Craft check to determine whether the item functions as intended. If you fail the check subtract 10% of the item's full price from the Craft result that have been applied. If the resulting number is still high enough for the item to be finished, then the item functions normally. If not, the item merely looks finished, but is not. The craftsman can elect either to spend more time to finish the project (by making more day-by-day Craft checks) or to pass the item off as fully functional. The user of an unfinished item take a -2 penalty on skill checks, attack rolls, or saving throws made when the performance of the item is tested - when a weapon is wielded in combat, when a vehicle is piloted or driven, when armor is subjected to an attack, and so forth.  
If you fail this final check by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the raw materials cost again.  
The DC for this is based on the complexity of the item, as given in the accompanying table.  

| Item Complexity 	| Basic Tools Cost 	|  DC 	| Examples                                                                                                                                                                	|

_Example:_ Kaz decides that he will construct a comlink for his friend Spin. The price of a comlink is 200 credits. So he pays 67 credits for the components: an energy cell, a circuit board, a power switch, some diodes, magnets, and a housing. He then makes his first Craft (electronic devices) check. His skill modifier is +8, and he rolls a 14, for a total of 22. Kaz then multiplies 22 (his result) by 8 (his skill modifier), for a total of 172. The comlink is mostly finished, but Kaz will need at least one more day.  
Unfortunately, Kaz is injured the morning of the second day, and must rest rather than work. Spin decides to take over, because he needs the comlink in a hurry. Spin uses Craft (electronic devices) untrained, since he has no ranks, though he has an Intelligence modifier of +2. He rolls his Craft check and get a 16, for a total of 18. Spin multiplies 18 by 2, for a total of 36. With Kaz's 176, that's 212 - more than enough to complete the comlink.  
Now comes the tricky part. Kaz recovers and checks Spin's work on the comlink, thus making the final check to make sure that comlink functions properly. The complexity of a nonencrypted comlink is medium, so Kaz has to beat a DC of 10 on his check. But Kaz rolls a 1 - for a total of 9 - not enough! The GM now deducts 10% of the comlink's cost (20) from the total of Craft results (212), for a result of 192.  
Kaz now has the option of spending another day working on the comlink or passing it off as "finished". Kaz cannily opts for the latter, and gives Spin his new comlink. Because there is no check or roll involved with using a comlink, though, the -2 penalty does not apply; instead, the GM decides that the comlink will occasionally cut out in the middle of a conversation.  
**Retry:** For the final check in constructing an item, yes, but each time you miss by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again. You may not retry a roll on a daily progress check.  
**Special:** You can take 10 on a Craft skill check, but you can't take 20.  
**Time:** Craft checks are made by the day, as described above.  
**Vitality Point Cost:** None.
