You can increase you prowess in combat, using the Force to enhance you concentration and commitment in battle.  
**Check:** A Battlemind check grants a Force bonus on attack rolls as shown in the table below. You can decide to select a bonus that's less than the result you achieve.  

| Result  	| Force Bonus 	|
|---------	|:-----------:	|
| Up to 4 	|      +1     	|
| 5-14    	|      +2     	|
| 15-24   	|      +3     	|
| 25-34   	|      +4     	|
| 35+     	|      +5     	|

**Retry:** None.   
**Special:** You can take 10 when making a Balance check, but you can't take 20.  
A character with the Mettle feat and at least one rank in this skill gets a +2 aptitude bonus on Battlemind checks.  
**Time:** Activating Battlemind is a move action. The Force bonus lasts 10 rounds (1 minute).  
**Vitality Point Cost:** 2 plus the Vitality Points equal to the bonus achieved. So, if the result provides a +2 Force bonus, the vitality point cost is 4.
