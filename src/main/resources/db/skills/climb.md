**Name: Climb (STR)**  
_Armor Check Penalty_    
Use this skill to scale a cliff, to get to a window on the second story of a building, or to climb up an antenna array after falling out of an airway at the bottom of a floating city.  
**Check:** With each successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope or a wall or other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds).  
A slope is considered to be any incline of less than 60 degrees or steeper.  
A failed Climb check indicates that you make no progress, and a check that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have attained.  
The DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb.  


|  DC  	| Example Wall or Surface                                                                                                                            	|
|:----:	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
|   0  	| A slope too steep to walk up. A knotted rope with a wall to brace against.                                                                         	|
|   5  	| A rope with a wall to brace against or a knotted rope, but not both.                                                                               	|
|  10  	| A surface with ledges to hold on to and stand on, such as a very rough wall.                                                                       	|
|  15  	| Any surface with adequate handholds and footholds (natural or artificial), such as a very rough natural rock surface or a tree. An unknotted rope. 	|
|  20  	| An uneven surface with some narrow handholds and footholds.                                                                                        	|
|  25  	| A rough surface, such as a natural rock wall or brick wall.                                                                                        	|
|  25  	| Overhang or ceiling with handholds but no footholds.                                                                                               	|
|   -  	| A perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surface cannot be climbed.                                                                                      	|
| -10* 	| Climbing inside an air duct or other location where one can brace against two opposite walls (reduces normal DC by 10).                            	|
|  -5* 	| Climbing a corner where you can brace against perpendicular walls (reduces normal DC by 5).                                                        	|
|  +5* 	| Surface is slippery (increases normal DC by 5).                                                                                                    	|
\* These modifiers are cumulative; use any that apply.  
Since you can't move to avoide an attack while climbing, opponents get a +2 bonus on attack rolls against you, and you lose any Dexterity bonus.  
Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means that you fall from your current height and sustain falling damage.  
_Accelerated Climbing:_ You can try to climb more quickly than normal, attempting to cover your full speed in climbing distance, but you take a -5 penalty on climb checks.  
_Making Handholds and Footholds:_ You can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute oer piton, and one piton is needed per meter. As with any surface with handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with an ice axe or similar implement can cut handholds or footholds in and ice wall.  
_Catching Yourself When Falling:_ It's practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall's DC + 20) to do so. A slope is relatively easier to catch yourself on (DC = slope's DC + 10).  
**Retry:** None.   
**Special:** Someone using a rope can haul a character upward (or lower the character) by means of sheer strength. Use double your maximum load to determine how much weight a character can lift.  
You can take 10 while climbing, but you can't take 20.  
A character with the Athletic feat get a +2 aptitude bonus on Climb checks.  
**Time:** Climb at one-half of your speed as a full-round action. You can move half that far, one-fourth of our speed, as a move action.  
Accelerated climbing allows you to climb at your full speed as a full-round action. You can move half that far, one-fourth of our speed, as a move action.  
**Vitality Point Cost:** None.
